I can tell you it's been hard to program this assignment after the semester since I had to fly across the country to visit family right after the semester ended. Since this assignment was optional if we did the final test (which I did), I'm going to ask that if this assignment brings my grade down, that you just dismiss it and don't add it to my grade. Thanks
